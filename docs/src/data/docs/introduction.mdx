## Introduction

`micro-stacks` is a library of JavaScript modules that enable you to interact with
the Stacks ecosystem. The primary goals of this library are as follows:

- Core has no extra dependencies (just 2 dependencies: [noble-secp256k1](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-secp256k1), [noble-hashes](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-hashes)).
- Modular: take what you need, leave what you don't.
- ESM based, works with all modern bundlers.
- 100% deno compatible.
- Expo / React Native support.
- Un-opinionated core.
- Opinionated framework integrations.
- Use with wallet based authenticators.
- Highly typed -- written in typescript.
- Well tested.

### Differences from stacks.js

`stacks.js` (previously known as `blockstack.js`) has years of use and maintenance behind it (which I have contributed
towards), and it serves as a great foundation for building apps that use Gaia or interact with the Stacks Blockchain in
some way. However, it has some (very well known and battle-tested) libraries that are huge in bundle-size which power
its various cryptographic/blockchain functions. The most notable packages are: `elliptic`, `bitcoinjs-lib`, `bip39`,
and `bn.js`.

Outside the libraries and dependencies that `stacks.js` has, there are long-standing, opinionated choices that have been
made around how things should be used, mostly related to authentication and storage. I've spent years building <s>Block</s>Stacks
apps and `micro-stacks` is the culmination of my hopes and dreams when it comes to the future for building apps
on the Stacks Blockchains.
